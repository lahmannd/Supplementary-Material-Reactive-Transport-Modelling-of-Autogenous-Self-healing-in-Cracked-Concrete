# Supplementary-Material-Reactive-Transport-Modelling-of-Autogenous-Self-healing-in-Cracked-Concrete

This data is submitted as supplementary material with the manuscript "Reactive Transport Modelling of Autgenous Self-healing in Cracked Concrete" by Daniel Lahmann and Sylvia Keßler (2024)

The Excel-file included in this package contains:
1) Detailed chemical composition of the water measured at C0, t and C1, t. The C0 data is required as INPUT data in the PHREEQC models.
2) Detailed pH-values, temperature and alkalinity measured at C0, t and C1, t. The C0 data is required as INPUT data in the PHREEQC models.
3) Detailed flow rate of each tested samples during sampling, as well as the time_step that is required for modelling in PHREEQC.
4) Modelling Output: Precipitation rates over time of the kinetic reactants calcite and M-S-H (als talc, chrysitile and brucite)
5) Modelling Output: Dissolution rates of portlandite, NaOH, KOH, C-S-H, ettringite and Afm over time. This sheet also contains calibrated molar transfger from the concrete matrix required as input for the REACTION keyword.
6) Calibrated Reactive surface area over time of calcite and M-S-H (as talc, chrysotile and brucite). This data is required as input for the KINETICS keyword imn PHREEQC.

In addition, an annotated PHREEQC input sheet is provided showing the input data for sample S4 for the first day of healing. This input data is highlighted in yellow in the supplementary Excel file. In the PHREEQC input sheet, the data for other measurement days or samples must be exchanged accordingly. Comments guide the reader through the PHREEQC file and highlight the input data and where it can be found in the Excel file.
