# Supplementary-Material-Reactive-Transport-Modelling-of-Autogenous-Self-healing-in-Cracked-Concrete

This data is submitted as supplementary Material with the manuscript "Reactive Transport Modelling of Autgenous Self-healing in Cracked Concrete" by Daniel Lahmann and Sylvia Keßler

Instittion: 
Helmut-Schmidt-University Hamburg/University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, Institute of Engineering Materials and Building Preservation, Charlie-Mills-Straße 2, 22159 Hamburg, Germany

The files included in this package contain:
1) Detailed chemical data (chemical composition, pH, alkalinity) of the water measured at C0, t and    C1, t that was used for the modelling.
2) Detailed flow rate of the samples over time.
3) Modelling Output:
   -Precipitation rates over time of the kinetic reactants calcite and M-S-H
   -Dissolution rate of portlandite over time
   -Reactive surface area over time
